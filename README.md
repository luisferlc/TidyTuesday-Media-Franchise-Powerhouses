# TidyTuesday-Media-Franchise-Powerhouses

One of my first attemps to plot with ggplot in R, which is part of the tidyverse package.

TidyTuesday is a community created by R4DS(https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity) in which they share a weekly free dataset to people, so they can practice their ggplot visualization skills.

When I started learning about R and tidyverse, this community on Twitter help me a lot to introduce me to R and ggplot in particular. 

Here are some plots I created for the 2019-07-02 submission which talked about franchises that have grossed at least $4 billion usd. Here you can find the details of the data: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-02
